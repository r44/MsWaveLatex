With the rise of the mobile devices, the similarity search among distributed machines for various types of dataset like images and audio is an increasingly important problem.  Moreover, in a distributed environment, the transmission cost is usually much more important than the computation cost.  Thus, in this thesis, we propose a framework which could conduct the similarity search amount a large number of distributed machines with the help of the orthogonal transformation.  On the basis of our previous work, we derive new bounds which allow us to prune impossible instances in the early stages of searching with the transmission of the partial query.  Besides, we improve the way to transmit the necessary information to calculate the bounds.  In our experiments, we compare the bandwidthe consumption of our proposed framework with other the state-of-the-art methods on various types of datasets.  We also compare the performance of our framework under different configurations.  Our results in these experiments show that our proposed framework could save much transmission cost when there are a large number of queries.
