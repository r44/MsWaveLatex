With the rise of the mobile devices, similarity search among distributed machines for various types of datasets like images and audio has become an increasingly important problem.  Moreover, in a distributed environment, the transmission cost is usually much more crucial than the computation cost as generally it consumes more resource to in transmission.  Thus, in this thesis, we propose a framework to conduct a bandwidth-efficient, exact k-nearest neighbor search amount a large number of distributed machines through exploiting the techniques of the orthogonal transformation.  On the basis of our previous work, new bounds on the Euclidean distance have been derived to prune impossible instances in the early stages of searching using partial information of the query.  Moreover, three additional enhancements are devised to further save the communication cost.  The experiment results show that our method significantly outperforms other competitions in bandwidth consumption in large-scale experiments of millions of instances.
